This is a sample work for Player Stats Card component done with node.js.

To run the app:
1. install npm and node.js
2. navigate to the contaning folder in command prompt and use the command 'node index.js' to start the server
3. open a browser and enter the url http://localhost:8080
4. (extra) if needed install node-sass with 'npm install -g node-sass' to compile scss to css

The project has been built using node.js, html, sass, js with a local http server as well as node-sass library. 
Sass has been set up to be watched and compiled to css after every modification. The file will be watched by using the 'npm run watchsass' command while the css file will compile with the 'npm run sass' command from the command prompt/terminal.
The localhost server can be started by using the command: 'node index.js' and thereafter the app can be accessed on any browser using http://localhost:8080 (in IE11 the http:// is necessary).
The player-stats.json file has been read and used to dynamically display data on the app.
